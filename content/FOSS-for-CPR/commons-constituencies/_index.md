A blockchain's stakeholders can be thought of as belonging to at least one of several different constituencies. Developers provide the infrastructure the network runs on, block producers provide the engine which drives it forward, merchants provide utility (by allowing it to be exchanged for other goods) and users/holders provide oversight to ensure that other participants follow the rules, and demand for the asset, which increases its value. The value of the asset (i.e. exchange rate with other assets) is always important because it determines the network's security budget - how much reward is available to incentivize block producers to participate honestly.

Each constituency has its own role to play in an ecosystem which produces this common pool resource and gives it value. Different projects define the boundaries of these constituencies and set up the relations between them in different ways. The way in which the network develops is determined through the interactions within and between these constituencies.

I refer to these sets of stakeholders of a particular type as constituencies, because it is typically the (strength of) consensus or majority opinion within a constituency that matters when considering the effect that constituency has on the project's commons.
