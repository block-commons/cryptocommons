As with other FOSS domains, developers are probably users. In Bitcoin's case, this means that early developers may well have been holders of some BTC while it appreciated in value by orders of magnitude.  Developers who held a significant amount of BTC through the price increases may now be independently wealthy and able to continue contributing without a need to generate an income from this or any other activity.

For early developers of a young blockchain project, obtaining some of the underlying asset makes sense if one believes that one's efforts will help to increase its value. This also serves to align one's incentives with the health of the network, and allows one to benefit financially from price appreciation that may be in some part due to one's work.

Developers who do not depend on any external party for an income are in the strongest position to try and influence the development of a blockchain project in the way that they see fit. Dependence on an external party for income may mean deferring to that party's judgement about the direction development takes.

The logic of "buy coins at $Y and invest effort to improve network's utility, increase demand for coins and raise their value to $Y x 10" also applies to organizations. Any large holder of a cryptocurrency is incentivized to see its price increase, and in some cases it may make sense to invest additional resources to fund developers' work. This scenario has the makings of a tragedy of the commons. As every holder benefits equally from price appreciation, each would prefer that the investment to improve utility came from other holders. Such investment may however have some influence payoff, depending on the relationship between the investor and the developers they fund. 

Blockstream is a company founded in 2014 by a group of Bitcoin developers with a [mission](https://blockstream.com/about/) to "build crypto-financial infrastructure based on Bitcoin".

> Blockstream provides funding for the development of [Bitcoin Core](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin_Core), the predominant bitcoin network client software.[[7\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream#cite_note-CoinDesk-7) It also employs a large number of prominent Bitcoin Core developers.[[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockstream#cite_note-:1-8)

> The company has raised $76M to date from investors, including venture capital firms [Horizons Ventures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizons_Ventures) and Mosaic Ventures.

Blockstream's business model is in some ways similar to the software as a service model of companies like RedHat. Blockstream develops the open source software (Bitcoin Core in this case) alongside services which rely on that software and which generate revenue for the company. Where Blockstream is different is that the services it provides rely on the Bitcoin network, not directly on the software but on the common pool resource that software is used to create. If Blockstream needs Bitcoin to do something new or differently to improve its service, it does not have the same unilateral power to push that change that a company like RedHat has. What Blockstream does have are some seats at the table in discussions about how the Bitcoin Core software should be further developed, in the form of the contributors it employs. 

Bitcoin Core in turn has the benefit of community trust and inertia built up over a number of years, making it quite entrenched with the vast majority of Bitcoin full nodes running this software implementation.

In addition to revenue-generating services, Blockstream may itself hold some of its assets in BTC, benefitting from price increases (and suffering from decreases). I do not know if this is the case. Blockstream could also be used by large BTC holders as a vehicle to invest in Bitcoin's development indirectly, hoping to benefit from both the Blockstream equity and the appreciation of BTC holdings. 

It is worth noting that Blockstream's efforts to enhance Bitcoin go beyond the Core software and its own revenue-generating products to encompass things like an array of [satellites](https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeldelcastillo/2018/12/17/who-needs-verizon-blockstream-broadcasts-entire-bitcoin-blockchain-from-space/#7536a7a95a80) continually broadcasting the entire Bitcoin blockchain. These allow a user anywhere in the world to obtain the data and verify the current state of the chain without even an internet connection (although a connection is still required to broadcast transactions). Investments such as this demonstrate that it is the common pool resource or network that matters, and that the task of improving its utility does not stop at the boundaries of software but can spill over to include the many other aspects which give that resource value.

More recently still, Blockstream [revealed](https://blockstream.com/2019/08/08/en-mining-launch/) that it had been growing its own PoW mining operation since the issue with PoW miners over SegWit in 2017 (see [here](/governance/bitcoin)).

It is this spillover and the degree to which the software is enmeshed in a resource with other important attributes that makes CBPP a useful lens to apply. I will argue below that the path to realizing this technology's potential lies in bringing more of the aspects that give the resource its strength and value "onto the commons".

Looking beyond Bitcoin, there are a number of other significant funding models to consider. I will describe some of these, along with some historical context.

Early cryptocurrencies could be mined effectively with a variety of consumer hardware, in the early days CPUs were sufficient, later GPUs came to dominate mining and later ASICS (specialized chips which only mine a particular set of cryptocurrencies) were developed. As better hardware becomes available, the older hardware quickly becomes unprofitable to use. At the launch of Bitcoin, Litecoin and other early blockchains, mining was the domain of enthusiasts using whatever hardware they had available. The competition to find new blocks and obtain the rewards was not fierce, and so any dedicated enthusiast could expect to obtain a reasonably large share of the rewards. For very early contributors, all they had to do was set up one or more of their computers to mine Bitcoin and they would be able to accumulate some. There was a technical barrier here too, where a contributor would have the appropriate skills to set up a miner but outsiders (particularly non-technical people) would have found this much more difficult. 

As Bitcoin gained recognition and traction, mining became more professionalized, with economies of scale and advances in hardware greatly limiting the degree to which hobbyists could participate beneficially. 

For a group of developers starting a new cryptocurrency, there was now no guarantee that they would be able to mine any significant share of the coins before professional miners squeezed them out. By 2018, a new PoW blockchain could have firms with significant investment and hardware lined up to begin mining as soon as it launched (example: [Grin](https://www.coindesk.com/grin-launch-crypto-interest-from-deep-pocketed-investors)). This left developer teams looking to launch new blockchain projects with a choice to either build in a funding mechanism through which they could receive funding and/or some of the coins, or to move to a donation oriented model for funding development.
