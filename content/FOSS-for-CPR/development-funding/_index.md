Of the Bitcoin constituencies referenced above, the motivation or incentive of the developers is most difficult to pin down. Miners are handsomely rewarded for the role they play in securing the network, merchants have built a business which relies on the network to function, and users avail of the service the network provides (or hold their coins in speculation that they will increase in value as more people wish to obtain them and use the service the network provides in future). 

Developers may be (and most likely are) intrinsically motivated to participate, in the same way that they typically are with other FOSS projects. Blockchain projects also have the capacity to fund development in some ways which are familiar from other FOSS domains (Software as a Service, patronage, and donations), and some which are unique to the cryptocurrency space (appreciation of holdings, ICOs, block reward funding). This section considers the ways in which blockchain development is incentivized and funded, and how those funding mechanisms affect the relationship between developers and the other constituencies. The following section considers the related question of how the blockchain is governed, where the relationship between developers and the other constituencies is a significant factor. 

The centrality of the software to the blockchain means that developers will always tend to have some influence over the course its development takes, but the nature and degree of this influence vary significantly between projects. The sense of being part of the team which is facilitating and steering the course of a blockchain's development is likely a big incentive for participation, irrespective of whether and how that participation is compensated.
