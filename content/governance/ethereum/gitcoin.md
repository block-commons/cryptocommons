[Gitcoin](https://gitcoin.co/) is a platform which aims to connect people with skills and desire to work on FOSS projects with people or organizations who have a need and resources to fund the required work. At its core is a bounty type approach where jobs are created with prospective payouts available to whoever completes them, but there are also other mechanisms through which people can receive funding (e.g. grants). Gitcoin distributes funding in the form of cryptocurrency.

Gitcoin seems fairly closely allied with Ethereum, with the "Labs" product described as "Experiments to grow Ethereum". [One of these experiments](https://gitcoin.co/blog/radical-results-gitcoins-25k-match/) has been in [deploying the principles of "liberal radicalism"](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3243656), specifically quadratic voting, to fund 25 Ethereum infrastructure projects. This [post](https://medium.com/gitcoin/experiments-with-liberal-radicalism-ad68e02efd4) outlines how the experiment was designed, it can succinctly be described as "crowdfunding with matched donations", where the entity matching the funding weights its matching contributions more towards the projects which received many smaller donations. In this case Gitcoin had up top $25,000 to award in matching donations.

This kind of quadratic voting is intended to strike a balance between giving people who have or contribute more greater say, but according to a quadratic rather than linear relationship (if A donates 10x more than B, they get more influence but not 10x more influence). The concept is drawn from the book [Radical Markets](http://radicalmarkets.com/), which Vitalik Buterin has expressed support for - co-authoring a [post](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/liberation-through-radical-decentralization-22fc4bedc2ac) with the Radical Markets co-author Glen Weyl where Buterin states that they would be interested in applying the concepts to Ethereum.

The report on the experiment with this approach on Gitcoin suggested that collusion had taken place to distort the outcome. The difficulty in applying this kind of approach in the cryptocurrency context is its weakness to sybil attacks (where an individual can operate many accounts to appear as many individuals). Given the pseudonymous nature of cryptocurrencies and ease with which new wallets or addresses can be created, it is difficult to establish how many individual humans are represented in any set of wallets or addresses. Approaches like quadratic voting rely on being able to differentiate individuals (so that their influence can be weighted accordingly). It is usually not possible to do this within a blockchain ecosystem, and the capacity to reliably identify individuals would itself be a radical change for most blockchains - which some constituents would object to.

Gitcoin is one of many interesting examples of novel approaches to solving the problem of FOSS infrastructure funding, but it [does not itself have a firm funding model yet](https://gitcoin.co/not_a_token), and is currently exploring its options (which seem to include a token sale). There is an open EIP ([1789](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/1789)) from a Gitcoin co-founder Kevin Owocki which proposes that inflation funding (20% of issuance) be allocated to Ethereum "ecosystem stewardship".

Gitcoin and the "[RadicalxChange movement](https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-the-radicalxchange-movement-and-its-cypherpunk-appeal)" is a good example of experimentation with new economic models in the blockchain context.

Blockchains would appear to be ideal laboratories for experimentation with approaches to governance and economics, with their capacity to apply rules rigidly and all the problems of an emerging technology and mode of production to solve.
