Monero is a privacy-focused PoW cryptocurrency with no formal governance that makes regular hard fork upgrades. These hard fork upgrades include technical advances (like [bulletproofs](https://www.ccn.com/monero-forks-bulletproofs-integration-kicks-off-new-era-of-privacy-speed/), which decrease the on chain footprint of transactions) and also changes to the hashing function. 

The changes to the hashing function are made in pursuit of "ASIC resistance". When there is evidence which suggests that ASICs are active on the network, the hashing function is altered to make those ASICs obsolete. The Monero community is committed to the ideal that users of the network should be able to mine XMR, and see reliance on specialized hardware as a weakness. Conversely, there are sound arguments that this will result in weaker security because of the much larger pool of potential hashrate that could be deployed to attack Monero.

The first time the hashing function was changed, a number of [split Monero chains](https://monero.org/forks/) formed, most of which maintained the existing hashing algorithm. These forks have limited usage and low prices, some of them may have been instigated by the producer of Monero ASICS (which would become significantly less valuable after the change to consensus rules).

Monero is itself the result of a hard fork to the Bytecoin blockchain. Bytecoin was the first cryptocurrency to use CryptoNote, and when it [emerged](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=740112.0) that the developers appeared to have premined 82% of the total supply (while faking dates on blocks and a whitepaper) many forks appeared. Monero was the most successful survivor.

Hard forks are constructed by the Monero Core team following a rough consensus approach. Core developers participate in [logged IRC meetings](https://web.getmonero.org/blog/tags/dev%20diaries.html) monthly. 

In relation to funding of development work, Monero has one of the best-developed donation-based approaches, the community crowdfunding system (CCS, previously outlined in the [blockchain development funding section](/foss-for-cpr/development-funding/)). This approach has the advantage of not overly centralizing control of development funding. There are key people who make decisions about what the consensus is, but they don't have direct control or discretion over funds. The key action of donating XMR towards specific project budgets is permissionless, relying on the generosity of unknown external beneficiaries.

Reliance on short-term grants from unknown beneficiaries is not without problems. Income security is generally desirable for workers, and the lack of this security may exclude some people from contributing. 

The Electric Coin Company, which founded Zcash and is receiving a significant proportion of 20% of the ZEC issuance for the first 4 years, offers a stark contrast. During the currently unfolding kerfuffle about Zcash funding, the ECC [stated](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/zooko-wilcox-gives-zcash-community-154140125.html) that it required a minimum of 1 year's notice about whether new block reward inflation funding would be available after the "founder's reward" expires, or else they would have to start looking into other revenue sources. The [Zcash section](/governance/zcash/) has more information about this.

Writing in August 2019, the new version of the CCS has been live for almost 1 year (~11 months), there have been completed proposals which were paid out ~1500 XMR, worth $120,000 at today's price of $82. Work is in progress on a further 15 proposals (where the XMR has already been provided and is being held in escrow) - worth ~4600 XMR or $2.1 million at today's prices. Raising this kind of money through donation campaigns is an impressive feat, but the volume of funding passing through Monero's community crowdfunding system is relatively low compared to the funding enjoyed by some other projects.
