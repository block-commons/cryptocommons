FOSS starts from the basis of having all of the code on the commons, removing the possibility that anyone can seek to profit by restricting access to it. Anyone is free to use it and build on it, to extend it or turn it into something else. The ease with which a FOSS project can be forked and taken in an alternative direction limits the degree to which users or developers have to tolerate any behaviour they dislike from the entity which is producing the software - whether that's some odious new feature or an order to do something which contradicts one's own preference. There is no copyright restriction that prevents people from forming a new group to take a project in an alternative direction.

People who are paid to work on FOSS projects are still accountable to whoever is paying them, and there are FOSS projects where the dominant versions are more or less controlled by people on the payroll of a particular company. All FOSS projects can be positioned somewhere on a continuum between being entirely voluntary and being motivated largely by payments to contributors.

Many participants in FOSS projects work on them part time and do not need to generate an income from this work. For FOSS projects that are not suitable for enterprise support, and not integral to the operations of organizations that have resources to fund development - most contributors will be working on it part time in whatever time they can spare, independently of whatever they do to earn an income. 

Some participants and FOSS projects have found ways to generate an income by offering services tangential to the software, such as support with deploying the software or using it. 

Red Hat is an [example](https://www.wired.com/2012/03/red-hat/) of a company that managed to generate significant revenue by selling subscription-based support and guarantees about compatibility to businesses that wanted to deploy Linux in their operations. It is however a rare example of an organization that funds itself following this kind of model reaching a large size ($3.4 billion revenue in 2018).

Nadia Eghbal has written an excellent and comprehensive piece on "[the unseen labor behind our digital infrastructure](https://www.fordfoundation.org/about/library/reports-and-studies/roads-and-bridges-the-unseen-labor-behind-our-digital-infrastructure)" which explores the prevalence of open source code in our digital infrastructure and paints a picture of freely provided commons-based digital infrastructure that is often not being looked after by its main beneficiaries.  

The report describes several in depth examples of critical and widely used FOSS which is maintained on a shoestring budget by people who are stretched and typically do not want to spend time trying to secure or administer funding for the effort. The [Heartbleed OpenSSL bug](http://heartbleed.com/) is one well known example where widely used FOSS had an undetected significant exploit for a long time. The OpenSSL maintainers were stretched part-time volunteers, and the issue could likely have been avoided with more resources to fund coding and code review. 

Eghbal also notes that the ideology of "Free Libre" Open Source Software is less important to many people who have embraced OSS recently. Adoption of FOSS practices is increasingly based on broader recognition of the practical benefits.

More recently, it seems like the disconnect between FOSS utility and funding has been [receiving more attention](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/43zak3/the-internet-was-built-on-the-free-labor-of-open-source-developers-is-that-sustainable). Initiatives like Formidable's [Sauce program](https://www.formidable.com/blog/2019/sauce-program/) allow employees to bill for work they contribute in their own time to open source projects which are unrelated to the company's own interests. This is an example of an organization that gains a lot from FOSS deciding to give something back to support the commons. They are quite rare.

GitHub has recently launched a [sponsorship scheme](https://github.com/sponsors) through which open source developers can be sponsored, with GitHub matching the sponsorship received by developers in their first year up to a limit of $5,000. This is conceptually similar to [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/), which also connects content producers with consumers who are willing to fund their work. In the case of GitHub Sponsors it is woven into a platform which many FOSS contributors already use. These are centralized services, where the operator of the platform acts as a gatekeeper in deciding who can be funded through the platform. 

I will consider the ways in which blockchain projects are funded in a later section, this is arguably where most of the innovation in FOSS funding is taking place.
